# Workshop RHEL for Edge

This workshop is based in [https://github.com/RedHatGov/RFESummit2021](https://github.com/RedHatGov/RFESummit2021).

This workshop will also use playbooks from [https://github.com/MoyRivera/edge](https://github.com/MoyRivera/edge).

This workshop is an introductory workshop to show how to use RHEL **Image Builder** feature to build, deploy and manage RHEL for Edge deployments.

You need to have knoledge about Linux and ansible.

> ![IMPORTANT](icons/important-icon.png) This workshop has been tested using Fedora 35 as hypervisor and ansible controller node.

> ![IMPORTANT](icons/important-icon.png) All the playbooks should run with no problems on Fedora 35, RHEL 8 and CentOS Stream 8. Maybe some minor changes will have to be done for repositories if CentOS Stream 8 is used. The key words here are **should** and **maybe**. Remember that your definition of **minor** maybe it is not the same that mine :-P.

> ![IMPORTANT](icons/important-icon.png) If you do not have a RHEL family hypervisor you could use the RHEL 8 server for all the tasks except for running Virtual Machines as you need a virtualization techology to run this VM. In this case you will have to perform some steps manually.

## Workshop

You will need the following:

* An ansible controller node to deploy the workshop. (Your laptop for instance)
* A hypervisor, this workshop assumes that you use KVM. (Your laptop for instance)
* A RHEL 8 Virtual Machine.

Ansible playbooks will be used to deploy and configure all the infrastructure.
